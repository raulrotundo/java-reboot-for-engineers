# Java Reboot for Engineers â€” Learning Journal

This document contains notes, reflections, and explanations related to the concepts covered in the project.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to help engineers refresh and deepen their understanding of core Java concepts, including:

- Java fundamentals (types, OOP, exceptions)
- Collections and generics
- Concurrency (threads, executors, futures)
- Design patterns (Factory, Strategy, Singleton, Builder, Observer, Adapter, Command)
- Refactoring, SOLID principles, and code smells
- Immutability (Strings, custom immutable classes)

## Key Concepts

### Fundamentals

- **Main class**: Entry point for Java applications. The `main` method is where execution begins.
- **OOP**: Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are core principles.
- **Exceptions**: Used for error handling and control flow.

### Collections

- **List, Set, Map**: Common data structures for storing and managing groups of objects.
- **Generics**: Enable type safety and code reuse.
- **Streams**: Functional-style operations for processing collections.

### Concurrency

- **Threads**: Allow multiple tasks to run in parallel.
- **Executors**: Manage thread pools and task execution.
- **Futures/CompletableFuture**: Handle asynchronous computation results.

### Design Patterns

- **Factory**: Creates objects without specifying the exact class.
- **Strategy**: Enables selecting algorithms at runtime.
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance.
- **Builder**: Simplifies object construction.
- **Observer**: Allows objects to be notified of changes.
- **Adapter**: Converts one interface to another.
- **Command**: Encapsulates requests as objects.

### Refactoring

- **SOLID principles**: Guidelines for writing maintainable and scalable code.
- **Code smells**: Indicators of potential problems in code.
- **Refactoring**: Improving code structure without changing its behavior.

### Immutability

- **Strings**: Immutable by design in Java.
- **Custom immutable classes**: Use `final` fields, no setters, and defensive copies to ensure immutability.

## How to Use

- Review the code examples in each module.
- Run the demos independently using their `main` methods.
- Explore the test cases for practical usage and verification.
- Add your own notes and reflections below as you learn.
